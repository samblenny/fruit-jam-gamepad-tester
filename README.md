# Fruit Jam Gamepad Tester

![screenshot of DVI output from Fruit Jam Gamepad Tester](fruit-jam-gamepad-tester-demo.png)

This an updated version of my old gamepad tester. The new one is for Fruit Jam.

- guide: [Feather TFT Gamepad Tester with Sprites](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/samblenny/pages/feather-tft-gamepad-tester-with-sprites)

**CAUTION:** This code was developed and tested on a pre-release revision B
Fruit Jam prototype board using CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha builds from the
circuitpython.org
[Fruit Jam downloads](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_fruit_jam/) page.
As I write this, USB support for Fruit Jam is under active development. Things
may change by the time CircuitPython 10.0.0 is released.
