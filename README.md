# Fruit Jam Gamepad Tester

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is going to be an updated version of my old gamepad tester. The new one is
for Fruit Jam.

Links for the old ESP32-S3 Feather TFT gamepad tester:

- guide: [Feather TFT Gamepad Tester with Sprites](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/samblenny/pages/feather-tft-gamepad-tester-with-sprites)

**CAUTION:** This code is getting developed and tested on CircuitPython
10.0.0-alpha.4 build from the circuitpython.org
[Fruit Jam downloads](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_fruit_jam/)
page. As I write this, USB support for Fruit Jam is under active development.
Things may change by the time CircuitPython 10.0.0 is released.
